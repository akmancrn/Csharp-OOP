What is the OOP(Object Oriented Programming)?

OOP, provide you to write regular code.

The typed code is stored in classes and OOP also is a code design that this classes provide used again.

If size of the project very big and complex, OOP is be very useful , also this method increase speed of the project.

Class,polymorphism,encapsulation,Inheritance

--CLASS--
The class is a data type that the object is described.

--OBJECT--
object is a model that deriving from class and its carrying its feature and used again again.

                                              public  class fruit{

                                                            fruit apple = new fruit();
                                                           fruit strawberry;}
--POLYMORPHÄ°SM--
Of different objects is to respond different form that same situations

--ENCAPSULATION--
This feature stores that the of fragments unnecessary of language used by user.
The codes in the class protect with private access.
If somebody want to use, the access either will be reach with permission or is not reach.

--INHERITANCE--
The heritance take from a under class that the features of class. Also is used as if its class.
The heritance defines new classes on the class. and we explain as permission given for authority
Both at the current class add new feature and in the under class is taked feature.
